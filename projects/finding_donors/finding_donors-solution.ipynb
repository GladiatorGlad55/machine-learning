    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "* **Real-world applications**: Manufacturing fault diagnosis, recommendation engines, college admissions\n",
    "* **Strengths**: Feature selection done automatically.  No need to normalize, scale features.  Not as sensitive to outliers.  Trees are easily explainable.  Trees can handle qualitative variables without the need to provide dummy variables.\n",
    "* **Weaknesses**: Needs to be remodeledif a new training set is added.  Prone to overfitting, especially with data with a lot of features.  Fits to noise.  Not as performant as other classifier solutions.\n",
    "* **Candidate Reasons: Less sensitive to outliers, will help in identifying predictive features.\n",

    "### Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)\n",
    "* **Real-world Applications**: Bioinformatics, Search engines, ranking, Face detection\n",
    "* **Strengths**: Can be run in parallel.  Seldem overfits and handles missing values.  Gives good non-linear approximations.\n",
    "* **Weaknesses**: Best used with parameter tuning.  Biased in multi-class problems towards more frequient classes. More complex modeling paradigm.\n",
    "* **Candidate Reasons**: Gives better approximate results (interpretability) with less bias than linear classification approaches.  Less prone to overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "* **Real-world Applications**: character recognition, image recognition, spam filtering\n",
    "* **Strengths**: Uses regularizaton to avoid overfitting.  Predictions can be interpreted as class probabilities.  \n",
    "* **Weaknesses**: Underperforms when theare are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries.  Can't handle binary categorical features very well.  Makes weaker assumption than GaussianNB\n",

    "Gradient Boosting as one of several ensemble methods is the most appropriate algorithmic approach for identifying individuals that make more than $50,000. The Gradient Boosting algorithm was the most performant in terms of accuracy and precision, proved resistant to overfitting, and incurred only a slight time consumption penalty relative to the fastest performing classifier.  The Decision Tree Classifier was the second best performing predictor, but appeared to overfit data with the smaller sample sizes at near 100% predictions rates and close to 100% at the larger size. Support Vector Modeling was suprisingly subpar with the worst set of accuracy and f1 scores and taking orders of magnitude more time to train the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GB classifer had an accuracy score of ~84% and f1beta score of 67% on full sample-size test data, better than both Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines.  When comparing training times over full sample sizes, there appeared to be a growing time penalty as data scaled relative to decision tree (without ensemble) classifiers, but the multiple was very small compared to SVM.  Once trained, prediction times for the Gradient Boosting Classifier across various sample sizes was on par with best performing classifiers compared in this project.  "

    "Ensemble methods, often working over decision tree classifier by default, stratify and segment sub-spaces of the entire sample space using many processes, called weak learners, in parallel to resample data and combine the results to produce a more accurate consensus result that is less susceptible to variance.  Boosting, in contrast to bagging, uses a number of sub-trees on resampled data in sequence such that the execution of weak learners are not totally indpendent from each as is the case in bagging.  Rather, information from one weak learner informs the construction of the next, employing a process of iterative improvement.  This approach is also conducive to identifying the most impactful set of features on the response variable.  \n",

    "More education is intuitively related to higher earning power, the motivation for many to go to college, independent of other features except for perhaps occupation.  Education level and education number are highly correlated, thus both will be linked to a higher probability of earning more than 50k.  As time passes, people of all education levels and occupations accumulate more experience and disposable income, so age is another determinant of income, probably not as strong of a functional determinant as education, but probably tne next strongest in terms of impact.  Types of occupations, such as white collar or managerial positions, also come with higher incomes.  Finally, the native country might be a significant predictor because it's level of development could affect the number and composition of jobs within the economy.  Developed countries will have a higher standard of living and higher wages than non-developed countries."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The model has ~3% less predictive accuracy and ~5% less precision when reducing the number of features to the five most impactful.  If training time was a factor and if accuracy could be sacrificed to gain a time benefit, it would be worth considering reducing the feature set to more efficiently calculate and produce results.  Getting better metrics on how much training and predict times are reduced with reduced features (and the elimination of one-hot encoding) would be a critical piece of information to be considered as part of making the decision."
